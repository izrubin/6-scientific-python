    "### Where did you get stuck in the assignment? What was the problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### I had a hard time getting the function with multiple arguments to. This function was the one that had filter(min,max).calculate_statistics(). I couldn't figure out how to get the program to recognize both attributes of the function. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What changes did you make upon seeing a completed version?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### I had stored many more attributes in the init function than I needed too. So I went through and removed those. All that changed was how I needed to call the function when using it in python. I also changed the filter functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What did you learn from reviewing the completed assignment?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The filter functions made more sense to me after reviewing the completed assignment. Also, how the functions fit into together within the larger class item made more sense to me. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What aspect of the code/assignment is still confusing you?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When I ran the altered code it was still telling me that simulate wasnt part of seqlib. So i went back to my seqlib.py file and added the self.simulate() into the init function. I'm a little confused as to how to make it work without that, since I feel like it should be running the simulate in order to make the array its supposed to output. I think I am also a little confused on how the double argument works, the same one that I mentioned in the first question. Also, I couldnt get this new code to actually fill in the filtered array, so the filter.calcualate_statistic was just giving me the 'else' response. "

## Code Review Instructions
This week for Code-review everyone will be reviewing their own code after 
viewing a working version of the assignment by me. I realize that many 
people found this assignment challenging, and rightly so, it was very 
difficult. And I apologize that the very last part of the assignment was even 
more difficult still than I had anticipated. But many people got stuck far
before that. We will go over the assignment in class, but before then your 
code review is intended as a chance for you to compare your assignment to the
completed version to assess where and why you got stuck, if you did.


## Instructions outline:

1. View a working version of the assignment in the `seqlib` repo of the programming-for-bio GitHub page [here](https://github.com/programming-for-bio/seqlib).

2. Read and interpret the code, and modify your version of seqlib so that 
it can complete the (modified) assignment as shown in the 
[example README here](https://github.com/programming-for-bio/seqlib). 
Upload your seqlib library as a repo to GitHub (this was part of the original
assignment that many people did not complete.)

3. Create a markdown document *with embedded code examples* with responses
to the following three questions:
	+ where did you get stuck in the assignment? What was the problem?  
	+ what changes did you make upon seeing a completed version?   
	+ What did you learn from reviewing the completed assignment?  
	+ what aspect of the code/assignment is still confusing to you?  

5. In your forked version of the 6-scientific-python repo, add your markdown
code-review document to the `Code-Review/` directory and name it 
`<github-username>-code-review-6.md`. Commit and push to your repo and then
make a pull request to programming-for-bio to submit it.
